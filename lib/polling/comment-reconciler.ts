/**
 * Comment reconciliation (polling safety net).
 *
 * Instagram webhooks are best-effort and never fire for a large class of
 * comments (collapsed "load more" comments, non-follower / low-signal accounts,
 * anything Instagram filters). Those comments are otherwise invisible: never
 * replied to, never DM'd.
 *
 * This sweep is deliberately narrow. For each active campaign it looks only at
 * that campaign's post, only at recent comments, and acts on a comment ONLY when
 * both are true:
 *   1. the comment matches the campaign keyword, and
 *   2. the account owner has not already replied to it.
 * The reply check reads the comment's actual replies on Instagram, so a comment
 * you (or the tool) already answered is skipped — the poll never re-touches
 * handled comments. Each sweep is capped so it can never flood the comment API
 * (which Instagram rate-limits aggressively, error 368).
 *
 * It runs on an interval in the worker process because Vercel's free crons only
 * fire once a day. Matching and sending reuse the worker's processComment, so
 * rate limiting and logging behave exactly as for webhook-delivered comments.
 *
 * Known limitation, handled not fixed: comments removed by Instagram's Hidden
 * Words / spam filter may not be returned by the Graph API at all. Disable that
 * filter on the account to widen results.
